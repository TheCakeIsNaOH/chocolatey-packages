    <description>The AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™ application is designed to provide you with a powerful yet easy-to-use interface where you can quickly access the latest software features, game stats, driver updates and much more. Take advantage of AI-powered features like our built-in AMD Chat, or enable AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 4, our new ML-based upscaling technology that takes your performance to the next level.

### Notes
- If not installing this driver fresh or updating an outdated version, I suggest [DDU](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ddu) to clean existing graphics drivers installed on the system.
- This uses the "combined" version of the installer which appears to have the broadest model support of the installer variants available.

#### Limitations
- This package currently only supports installing the configuration of applications and drivers that the installer autoselects.
- This package tracks the latest version of the software. See release notes for suppported AMD products. Contributions welcome for detection of supported products.
- The uninstall is currently not silent. The documented silent switch in the uninstaller executable (-uninstall) does not work. Contributions welcome for a silent switch or to script uninstallation.
