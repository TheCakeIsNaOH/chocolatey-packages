The example of use together with WMAENCODE.EXE:

balcon -f d:\book.txt -n Heather -o -il | wmaencode - d:\book.wma --ignorelength


*** Configuration File ***

The command line options can be stored as a configuration file "balcon.cfg" in the same folder as the utility.

The sample configuration file:
===================
-f d:\Text\book.txt
-w d:\Sound\book.wav
-n Microsoft Anna
-s 2
-p -1
-v 95
-e 300
-d d:\Dict\rules.bxd
-lrc
--lrc-length 75
--lrc-enc utf8
--lrc-offset 300
===================

The utility may combine options from the configuration file and the command line.


*** Audio Clips ***

The application allows to insert links to external WAV and MP3 files (audio clips) into text. Audio clip tag will look like:

{{Audio=C:\Sounds\ring.wav}}

When speaking text aloud, the utility will pause when the audio clip tag is reached, play the audio clip and resume speaking.
When converting to audio files, the audio clip will be embedded in the audio file created by the application.


*** "Voice" Tag ***

If it is necessary to change a voice or its properties during reading aloud, a special tag can be used for SAPI 5 and Microsoft Speech Platform (SAPI 4 voices will ignore this tag).

The tag format:

{{Voice=Name;Rate;Pitch;Volume}}

- Name: the name of a voice (one word or the part of a word is enough);
- Rate: the rate of a voice (values range from -10 to 10);
- Pitch: the pitch of a voice (values range from -10 to 10);
- Volume: the volume (values range from 0 to 100).

A tag applies to all subsequent text. The values are separated by semicolons. For example:

This text will be spoken by the default voice of Balabolka. {{Voice=Kimberly;0;0;100}} The voice 'Kimberly' will read the other text.

The tag's content is case insensitive. Values for some properties can be omitted:

{{voice=eric;;;50}}

{{Voice=Hans;-1}}

{{Voice=Rachel}}

To return to the default voice, use this tag:

{{Voice=}}

Warning! It is impossible to switch between SAPI 5 voices and voices of the Microsoft Speech Platform.


*** "Pause" Tag ***

A specified number of milliseconds of silence can be inserted into the output audio file. For example:

One hundred twenty milliseconds of silence {{Pause=120}} just occurred.
